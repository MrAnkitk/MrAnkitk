## **👨‍🎓 About Me**

I approach data problems with a **business-first and insight-driven mindset**.  
For me, analysis is not just about charts or queries — it’s about **answering the right questions and enabling better decisions**.

**How I work:**
- Start with understanding the **business context** before touching the data  
- Clean and structure data to make it **analysis-ready and reliable**  
- Apply **statistical reasoning and exploratory analysis** to uncover meaningful patterns  
- Design **clear, intuitive dashboards** that communicate insights without overcomplication  
- Translate findings into **practical recommendations**, not just observations  

I strongly believe that **good analytics sits at the intersection of data, statistics, and design**, and my goal is to build solutions that are not only accurate, but also **useful and decision-ready**.
